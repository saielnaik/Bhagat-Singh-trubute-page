          Bhagat Singh was considered to be one of the most famous
          revolutionaries of the Bharatiya Independence movement. For this
          reason, he is often referred to as ‘Shaheed’ (martyr) Bhagat Singh. At
          such a young age, <strong> if anyone was smiling just before being hanged to
          death, it was Martyr Bhagat Singh.</strong></p>
          <p> His uncle, Sardar Ajit Singh, as
          well as his father, were great freedom fighters, so he grew up in a
          patriotic atmosphere. At an early age, he started dreaming of
          uprooting the British empire. Never afraid of fighting during his
          childhood, he thought of ‘growing guns in the fields’, so that he
          could fight the British.</p>
          <p> The Ghadar Movement left a deep imprint on
          his mind. Kartar Singh Sarabha, hanged at the age of 19, became his
          hero. The massacre at Jallianwala Bagh on 13th April, 1919 drove him
          to Amritsar, where he kissed the earth sanctified by the martyrs’
          blood and brought back home a little of the soaked soil. At the age of
          16, he used to wonder why so many Bharatiyas could not drive away a
          fistful of invaders.
